# Porthole App

Porthole is a screen-reader app that allows you to rest your eyes.  Instead of traversing your eyes across the screen, you can let the computer flash word in front of you, increasing your reading speed.

Porthole is build with React, Redux, Immutable and Express and deployed on Heroku
[here]('https://porthole-app.herokuapp.com/').

To run on your local machine run the following commands:
`npm install`
`npm start:dev`

This will start the create_react_app dev server script.
